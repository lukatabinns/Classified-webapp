Classified-webapp
=================
MY FIRST JOB 

My client requested a classified webapp with most of the features necessary for users to create an account and upload their items for display. The webapp was developed using Bootstrap along with HTML5 for front end, a PHP framwork and jquery. 
 If you wish for further details please contact me. This website should be launching soon if things go to plan. Please go here to see what the webapp looks like at MARKETVILLAGE.org.

If you don't believe it's my work please take a look at the top bar in the URL pane from the images in the blog. You will see that I am hosting the website on my local computer. the webapp was formally called imart but the client found that the domain name was not available.

The application is still a work in progress so you may see a few errors when using firebug.
